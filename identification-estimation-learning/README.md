# Identification, Estimation, and Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB implementations developed as coursework for the **Estimation, Identification, and Learning** class in my Mechatronics Engineering program.

All four projects are included in a single MATLAB file:  
**`identification-estimation-projects.m`**
