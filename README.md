# 🎓 University Projects – Khalid Mohamed

This repository contains academic projects completed during my undergraduate studies in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering at the University of Alexandria.

Projects span topics such as:
- Adaptive filtering (RLS, Kalman, Wiener)
- Neural networks
- Quantum probability visualization
- Control and robotics simulations
- Signal processing and machine learning

Each project is organized under the course it was developed for, with code written in MATLAB, Python, or Simulink.
