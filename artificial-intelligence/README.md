# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains Python implementations developed as coursework for the Artificial Intelligence class in my Mechatronics Engineering program.

The repository includes two main projects demonstrating search-based and reinforcement learning approaches.

## 📘 Included Projects

1. **Connect 4 AI Agent (Search-Based)**  
   Implements a Connect 4 game-playing agent that uses Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning and evaluation functions to choose optimal moves, capable of playing against a human or another AI.

2. **Gridworld Markov Decision Process (Reinforcement Learning)**  
   Implements a Gridworld MDP with value iteration and policy iteration, demonstrating fixed-point convergence guaranteed by the Banach theorem.
